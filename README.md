My Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing chatbot still in development. It is an AI Chatbot created by Python 3.9 on a Conda environment.

It is a Feed Forward Neural Net with two hidden layers. I used Pytorch framework and installed nltk, nltk Punkt and Numpy libraries for support on my arrays and sentences.
The NLP techniques I used are Stemming, Tokenization and Lemmatization

For training my data, I used Bag of Words "BoW" concept. Converted my strings to vector that contains numbers.
I defined my own tags & input different patterns and set up different possible responses then ran the whole training which implemented the training pipeline.
